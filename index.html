						<p>I oversaw a brand refresh for 360Giving, focusing on reflecting the charity's values and maturity. As part of this, I commissioned a new 'About Us' video. For this work, I commissioned and managed freelance user researchers, voice artists, designers, illustrators and animators, and signed off their work. I also wrote the script for the 'About Us' video.</p>

						<h3><a href="https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/reports/data-about-us"><span class="me-on-internet">#WeAreNotRobots</span></a></h3>
						<p>This project explored narratives around data rights and data ownership. Working with colleagues across partner organisations, I co-designed and delivered focus groups, co-authored a report and produced a graphic. I also managed a team of creatives – including voice artists and a hand puppeteer – to produce an animation to bring the findings to life. I promoted the findings by giving talks at conferences, including at MyData in Helsinki.</p>

						<h1 id="page-sub-heading">About</a></h1>

						<br>

						<p>I’ve worked in content for over 15 years, from journalism to creative production to content strategy. I love leading creative teams to communicate complex ideas in clear and compelling ways. I also just love writing and editing. Give me a half-baked idea for a blogpost and I’ll happily help you develop, write and publish it to a high standard in a short space of time. I genuinely find it fun.

						<p>What sets me apart as an independent consultant is that I provide high quality content services nimbly and cost-effectively. 

						<p>I’ve worked in-house and contracted for many different clients and organisations over the years: news platforms, charities and NGOs, private companies, government and individuals. They have broadly been focused on promoting human rights, data and tech ethics, and social justice.

						Recently I've been working as a content designer on GOV.UK, working with policymakers and multi-disciplinary service teams to create user-focused content.

						<p>I directed brand and content strategy as Head of Content at the <a href="https://theodi.org/"><span class="me-on-internet">Open Data Institute</span></a>. Over five years, I set tone of voice, built a production team and led on strategic outputs and events. Before that I helped set up the <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/cgd-europe"><span class="me-on-internet">Centre for Global Development in Europe</span></a>. 

						<p>I cut my teeth as a journalist, covering global development and human rights for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/annascott"><span class="me-on-internet">the Guardian</span></a>. I also sub-edited for a while on the Guardian's Cities and Culture desks. Before that, I wrote articles, quizzes and games for Trinity Mirror’s <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/usvsth3m/"><span class="me-on-internet">UsVsTh3m</span></a>.</p>

						<p>I have a Masters degree in Human Rights from University College London. My undergrad was in Anthropology and Politics.</p>
						
						<p>In my spare time, I make music, go to festivals and swim in really cold water for masochistic kicks.</p>

						<p>Services I offer:</p>

						<ul>
					      <li>Content strategy</li>
					      <li>Content design</li>
					      <li>Writing, copy-editing and proofreading</li>
					      <li>Lead creative production</li>
					      <li>Public speaking and panel chairing</li>	
					  </ul>
